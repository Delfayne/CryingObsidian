# Crying Obsidian
Crying Obsidian was intended to be a block that can change your spawn point, but it was never added to the game. This mod implements this block and adds an item version of it.

## Download
The mod can be downloaded on [CurseForge](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/crying-obsidian/files).
